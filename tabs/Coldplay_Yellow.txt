The intro, breaks, and outro would normally have the electric guitar riff but for playing solo \nyou can just play the B - F# - E. I included a simluation of the electric guitar riff that isn't entirely\nnecessary to the song, and doesn't fully do the riff justice (B Badd9 F# F#sus2 E6maj7 Emaj7 B Badd9). That \nprogression can also be played in the last break instead of what is shown below.\n[Intro]\nB  Badd9   B  Badd9\nB Badd9 F# F#sus2 Emaj7add6 Emaj7 B Badd9\n", "chords": "", "start": 0, "end": 0, "group": "intro"}, {"lyrics": "F#mMaj7   [244201] (this is what Chris plays in the outro on the record, but you might find it easier to", "chords": "", "start": 0, "stop": 0, "group": "F#mMaj7   [244201] (this is what Chris plays in the outro on the record, but you might find it easier to"}, {"lyrics": "[Verse 1]", "chords": "", "start": 0, "stop": 0, "group": "[Verse 1]"}, {"lyrics": "Look at the stars, look how they shine for you", "chords": "B                                           F#", "start": 0, "stop": 0, "group": "[Verse 1]"}, {"lyrics": "And everything you do yeah they were all yellow.", "chords": "                    Emaj7                          B", "start": 0, "stop": 0, "group": "[Verse 1]"}, {"lyrics": "I came along, I wrote a song for you", "chords": "B                                F#", "start": 0, "stop": 0, "group": "[Verse 1]"}, {"lyrics": "And all the things that you do and it was called Yellow.", "chords": "                           Emaj7                            B", "start": 0, "stop": 0, "group": "[Verse 1]"}, {"lyrics": "So then I took my turn oh what a thing to have done,", "chords": "Badd9        B     F#                             Emaj7", "start": 0, "stop": 0, "group": "[Verse 1]"}, {"lyrics": "And it was all yellow.", "chords": "                        B   Badd9", "start": 0, "stop": 0, "group": "[Verse 1]"}, {"lyrics": "[Chorus 1]", "chords": "", "start": 0, "stop": 0, "group": "[Chorus 1]"}, {"lyrics": "Your skin, oh yeah your skin and bones", "chords": "Emaj7*      G#m          F#                    ", "start": 0, "stop": 0, "group": "[Chorus 1]"}, {"lyrics": "Turn in - to something beautiful", "chords": "Emaj7   G#m           F#               ", "start": 0, "stop": 0, "group": "[Chorus 1]"}, {"lyrics": "And you know  you know I love you so.
